Taco Bell's Waffle Taco has been hyped up for a while now. I was sitting at McDonald's enjoying a Saturday morning McMuffin when the idea struck me to go check it out. Double breakfast? I like the way I think.

You know, I do love the smell of waffles. If they made waffle-scented Yankee Candles I would be all over that. I went to the Yankee Candle site but came away disappointed. Oh, and it doesn't always smell like waffles in the morning. Maybe they mean "If you're at Taco Bell, and it smells like waffles, it's morning."

Props to them for running breakfast later than Mickey D's, though. And being a better value. I feel like McDonald's breakfast isn't priced as cheaply as their regular menu.

As you can clearly see, I got the bacon-flavored waffle taco. So the basic idea behind waffle taco is egg, cheese, bacon with a waffle wrapped around it. I like that they didn't skimp on the bacon. It still looks a little empty inside. With a regular taco, the shell is thin and small and curvy so you don't notice it as much, I think.

I did not get the sense of impending doom that I got from the [Flamin' Cheetos burrito]({% post_url 2014-05-03-taco-johns-hot-cheetos %}), so I dove right in for a bite.

Hmm, this is actually... not bad. Note that I said "not bad" as opposed to "good." The waffle itself has a very subtle maple-y breakfast flavor that doesn't compete with the insides of the breakfast taco (think just a hint of Waffle Crisp flavor). They've actually done about as good as I would expect fast food to do on something this ridiculous. It's not crisp or sugary at all, which I think is a good decision. The waffle is just there to lend some structural fortitude and a whisper of maple.

If you look closely in the above picture, you'll notice an open syrup packet. I tried dunking the waffle taco in syrup to see how that would affect the flavor. Not recommended.

I also tried squeezing some fire sauce on and taking a bite. Eh, that was okay. It dominates the other flavors, as hot sauce is wont to do. Basically if you like hot sauce put hot sauce on it, but you don't need me to tell you that.

The biggest drawback was that the waffle was a grease sponge. check it out:

Mmm, greasy. That'll probably take a few years off your life if you eat it regularly. I wouldn't complain if I had to eat another waffle taco, but I don't think it's quite as good as the other options for TBell breakfast. Try the AM Crunchwrap if you get a chance.
